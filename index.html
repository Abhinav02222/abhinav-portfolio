      <p>I have a strong interest in technology and enjoy working with both design and logic. I am familiar with HTML and CSS for creating clean, responsive layouts, and I also have experience with Python and SQL for solving problems and handling data.

I like learning new things and understanding how different parts of a website or application function work together. I'm currently focused on improving my skills and expanding my knowledge in both design and development.</p>
